It’s like staring into a mirror and discovering more and more. Like similarities to plants, other animals and even microbes. You then start to see cross-connections. Your intestines are not so different from the roots of a tree, for example. And when you were crawling as an infant, you moved just like a crocodile. Recognizing these similarities makes you see yourself and the world around you in a different light. You realize how intertwined you are with all living things, down to the smallest fiber of your being. And that you are much less independent than you thought.",

The core of this story is the Battle of the Scheldt. In the autumn of 1944, Allied and German forces fought bitterly for control of the Western Scheldt, the waterway connecting the previously liberated North Sea port of Antwerp. This battle, often forgotten, was decisive for the subsequent liberation of Western Europe.\n\nTravel through history, starting with the rise of fascism and Nazism until the outbreak of the Second World War. Learn about the German invasion, the persecution of the Jews, the resistance and the liberation. Read personal stories and discover silent witnesses to the war in Zeeland. You’ll find these throughout the museum as well as outside it at the Bevrijdingspark Zeeland (Liberation Park Zeeland).\n\nOn your journey, you will see the effect of the horrors of war on both soldiers and civilians. Their suffering, pain, fear and grief are still palpable when listening to and reading their testimonies or examining the numerous photographs. The museum also focuses on the wartime experiences of the sailors of the merchant navy, as well as those of the Dutch forces deployed to the Dutch East Indies following the Second World War.",

The library presents a platform for free thought, inspired by the ideology of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica . Visit the café and garden. Marvel at the beautiful prints, taken from the works of 17th-century freethinkers and others. Feel welcome.\n\nFree thought is the capacity to formulate your own thoughts and ideas – independently, without boundaries or constraints and regardless of religion, culture and age.\n\nWhat does the museum offer?\nThe museum captures the imagination through 200 images from its collection. Discover the story behind each one! Take an audio tour, marvel at the treasures of our collection in the Kleine Sael - small hall - attend a lunchtime concert in the Grote Sael - great hall - or sign up for a guided tour through the house. Discover the collection and examine the books in the reading room and the lounge or find a place to enjoy a cup of coffee or tea in the café or the extensive garden. You can enjoy our vibrant online program of lectures and courses from home, too.\n\nAmsterdam and free thought\nHow is it that, all over the world, Amsterdam is associated with freedom? It is in the city’s DNA. And freedom is what every human truly longs for. Humans are the only creatures that search for truth and freedom, and want to know the whys and wherefores of everything around them. But there’s no freedom without wisdom. Wisdom transcends such phenomena as dictated truth, superstition, prejudice and fundamentalism. Wisdom connects us all, and creates freedom. Since the 17th century, Amsterdam has been famous for its freedom of religion, individual freedom and freedom of the press. Back then, books functioned as the internet does today: they spread knowledge and connected people.\n\nHouse with Heads\nThe Embassy of the Free Mind is located in the unique 17th-century city palace known as the House with Heads . This national heritage site was designed by Hendrick de Keyser in 1622. Six heads adorn the facade of the building. These represent the Roman deities Apollo, Ceres, Mercury, Minerva, Bacchus and Diana.",

Following its expansion in 2013, Huis Marseille has been able to showcase not only temporary exhibitions but also highlights from its growing in-house collection, creating deeper connections between past and present works.\n\nThe Houses\nThe museum is housed in two 17th-century canal houses, which feature many of the original details, such as lavish ceiling frescos, stucco, marble and a red Louis XIV style salon. The museum also includes a library, a specialist photography bookstore and a canalside garden.\n\nCollection\nHuis Marseille has acquired around 750 works of contemporary photography since it opened two decades ago. This includes the works of many internationally prominent photographers, such as Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff, Andreas Gursky, Andres Serrano, Deana Lawson, Viviane Sassen and Jean-Luc Mylayne. The exhibition also covers less well-known names. New additions to the collection include photos by Jamie Hawkesworth and Julie Greve, created at the crossroads of fashion and art.",

    "Description_Text": "Sonneveld House Museum, situated on the edge of Museumpark in Rotterdam, is one of the best-preserved homes built in the Dutch Functionalist style. Sonneveld House shows how a prominent Rotterdam family embraced modernism, and how that choice coloured their everyday surroundings.\n\nVan Nelle & Feyenoord\nThe villa was designed in the 1930s by architecture office Brinkman and Van der Vlugt, renowned for the Van Nelle Factory and Feyenoord Stadium. They also worked on the interior in close collaboration with W.H. Gispen.\n\nMuseum House\nSonneveld House, which enjoys national heritage status, was opened to the public in 2001 after undergoing restoration work to recreate the original condition of the house and interior.  Sonneveld House has, however, enjoyed a long history and been home to various residents. Above all else, the museum had to reconstruct the house of the Sonnevelds and offer a glimpse of how they lived there at the time. The benchmark for the restoration was therefore the condition of house when it was completed in 1933. Alterations made to the house while it was occupied by the Sonneveld family were also regarded as authentic. All alterations made after the family’s departure have been reversed.\n\nEnrichment\nIn addition, art and design from the 1930s, in particular glasswork, have been added to enliven the interior of Sonneveld Museum House. Although not among the original contents of the house, these objects could easily have graced the interior, given the preferences of the family, or because they blend harmoniously with the style of the house or the spirit of the times. Examples include the canary yellow breakfast service by H.P. Berlage and Piet Zwart on the dining table, a tea service, and various vases on loan from the National Glass Museum.\n\nNieuwe Instituut\nBook your ticket at the entrance of the house, at the box office in the Nieuwe Instituut, or online in advance. The ticket of Sonneveld House also provides access to the Nieuwe Instituut, Museumpark 25, Rotterdam.",

Jenever by any other name would taste as sweet. It has many names and fans. Want to know more about the traditional drink of the Netherlands? Visit the Nationaal Jenevermuseum.\n\nHow is jenever made?\nThe Jenevermuseum, housed in a former distillery, opened in 1996. See and smell how they used to make the traditional drink.

    "Description_Text": "Tucked away in a green landscape amid scenic gardens and creeks, Sepesteyn is vaguely reminiscent of Sleeping Beauty’s castle. It’s in this museum where Jonkheer Van Sypesteyn curated his art collection.\n\nA young castle\nAround 1900, aristocrat Henri van Sypesteyn built the castle on the foundation of an old building. This makes Sypesteyn quite a young castle, but it was furnished to look like the family had lived there for centuries. Items on display include four centuries of portraits of Henry’s ancestors and a large collection of porcelain, in addition to furniture, glassware, sculptures, 18th-century timepieces and even an armory with many suits of armor, weapons and firearms.\n\nHistoric garden\nVan Sypesteyn was also an authority on old Dutch garden architecture. The layout of his castle grounds reflects his ideas. He also planted a number of non-native trees that are now among the oldest in the country. In the early springtime, 35 species of steppe plants are in bloom – a genuine feast for the eyes.",

In the Max Havelaar, Multatuli denounced the Dutch government for their exploitation of the population and other abuses in the the former Dutch kolonies of the East Indies, which he witnessed as a civil servant. The book is still considered as one of the most important 'whistleblower' novels in Dutch literary history. For the first time, everyone could read about the seriousness of the situation in the colonies and, especially at the beginning of the 20th century, this fuelled resistance to colonialism. Even in his later work, Multatuli continued to campaign for the rights of minority groups. He made ardent pleas for the emancipation and suffrage of women and campaigned for workers' rights.\n\nWorkplace\nThe Multatuli museum houses Multatuli's workplace, furniture and books.

Visit the 18 authentically furnished rooms where the last German Emperor lived, and feel like you’re stepping back in time. After Germany’s defeat in World War I, Kaiser Wilhelm II fled to the Netherlands and lived here in exile.

Wilhelm II bought the manor in 1919 and overhauled both it and the 35-hectare park to provide all the comforts he required.\n\nThe furnishings at Huis Doorn were brought from the imperial palaces at Berlin and Potsdam. The interior remains unchanged since Kaiser Wilhelm II died in 1941, and presents an authentic view of imperial living.\n\nWorld War I\nHuis Doorn Museum links the personal story of the German Emperor to the history of the destructive First World War and the soldiers that fought in it.

All based on the largest painting in the Netherlands!\n\nMuseum Panorama Mesdag is iconic in The Hague, and the Panorama of Scheveningen is its highlight.\n\nThe Panorama’s history\n\nThe Panorama of Scheveningen is over 140 years old. In 1880, Hendrik Willem Mesdag was engaged by a Belgian panorama company to create the biggest painting he had ever done: a cylindrical painting (360 degrees) featuring his beloved Scheveningen. The painting depicted a panoramic view of the sea, dunes and the old fishing village of Scheveningen. Location: the Seinpostduin, which used to be the tallest dune in Scheveningen.\n\nLargest painting in the Netherlands\n\nWith a surface area of 1680 square meters, the Panorama of Scheveningen is the largest painting in the Netherlands. The painting is 14.6 meters tall and has a circumference of 114.5 meters. Mesdag couldn’t possibly have completed this herculean task all on his own. Sientje Mesdag-van Houten, George Hendrik Breitner, Théophile de Bock and Bernard Blommers – all famous painters at the time – helped him finish the panorama in four months. A fantastic achievement.\n\nCollection and exhibitions\n\nThe panorama isn’t the only thing worth seeing in Museum Panorama Mesdag. The permanent collection, with personal works by Hendrik Willem Mesdag and his wife, Sientje Mesdag-van Houten, is also worth a visit. Temporary exhibitions strive to connect the past and present, for example by reflecting on the panorama phenomenon and the way we depict nature.",

    "Description_Text": "The interior of the Museum Paul Tetar van Elven is among the 100 best conserved 19th-century interiors. Take a peek in the house and workshop of the artist who left his unique mark on the space here.\n\nPaul Tetar van Elven, the artist, collector and teacher of drawing, lived in this canal house at the Koornmarkt in Delft from 1864 until 1894. As an artist, he mainly painted portraits, historical pieces and copies of old masters, a selection of which is hanging on the museum walls.\n\nPersonal style\nPaul Tetar van Elven bestowed his own unique and personal touch on the house. In 1886, as a homage to the old masters, he hired Abraham Gips, his successor at Polytechnische School in Delft, to paint the names of the old masters on the ceiling of his salon. The rooms are lined with antique furniture, Asian porcelain and Delftware, which gives a good impression of what life was like for the 19th-century bourgeoisie.",

    "Description_Text": "Come to the Museum of the Mind | Outsider Art at the Hermitage, Amsterdam to witness disarming naive art. Step into a totally new world and be swept along by these artists’ wild rollercoaster.\n\nVisit the permanent collection and don’t forget about the temporary exhibitions. These artists were not held back by the traditional conventions of art and their pure work depicts an unfiltered reflection of their inner world.\n\nProminent works by national and international Outsider artists\nOver the last few years, Outsider Art has been making real advances into the art world. No surprise there, since this art movement knows how to grab you and never let you go.\n\nThe Outsider Art movement gained much notoriety after the First World War. In 1922, psychiatrist Hans Prinzhorn (1886-1933) published his influential book Bildnerei der Geisteskranken (Artistry of the Mentally Ill), which featured a large collection of works created by people in psychiatric institutions. This book served as an inspiration to many artists, including Salvador Dalí, Karel Appel and Asger Jorn.\n\nIn 1929, the Museum of Modern Art in New York was one of the first museums to show interest in this art form. Curator Alfred Barr considered self-taught art one of the three ‘major movements in modern art’, the other two being surrealism and abstract art.\n\nIn 1949, the French artist Jean Dubuffet came up with the term ‘Art Brut’, ‘raw art’. The English art historian Roger Cardinal introduced the term ‘Outsider Art’ in 1972.\n\nIn 2013, the Venice Biennale caused a breakthrough for Outsider Art in the international art world. The founding of the Museum of the Mind | Outsider Art in the Hermitage Amsterdam has offered a permanent opportunity to witness the development of Outsider Art in the Netherlands since March 16, 2016.",

It tells a story of exclusion, persecution and murder – but also of salvation, survival and solidarity.\n\nHistoric importance\nThe museum is located in the former Dutch Reformed Church teacher training school on the Plantage Middenlaan, in Amsterdam. This building is of major historic importance because during the war, hundreds of Jewish children were smuggled to safety from the daycare center next door to this building, then to various safehouses. The National Holocaust Museum tells the story of the persecutions of Jews in the Netherlands trough permanent and temporary exhibitions, events and educational programs.\n\nVictims and responsibility\nVisitors learn how the Holocaust could happen, about its victims and perpetrators. Most importantly, the museum teaches us how to prevent it all from happening again. Authentic artefacts and locations emphasize this building’s importance during the war, like the spot where children were handed over to members of the Dutch resistance. This is where the rescue really began.\n\nDiscrimination\nThe National Holocaust Museum commemorates the victims of the Holocaust and discusses the consequences of indifference and discrimination, in both the past and present.\n\nTogether, the National Holocaust Museum, Jewish Museum , Portuguese Synagogue and Hollandsche Schouwburg make up the Jewish Cultural Quarter. The admission ticket is valid for all these locations for one week.\nDue to the great interest at the National Holocaust Museum, there is a chance that you will not be able to get a ticket at the box office if the time slots are fully booked. It is therefore recommended to purchase your ticket online in advance.",

The Oranjehotel (‘Orange hotel’) was a prison in Scheveningen where, among others, resistance members and Jews were interned during the Second World War.\n\n###Nazi prison ###\nBetween 1940 and 1945, over 25,000 people were imprisoned here for interrogation and trial. The prisoners were a diverse group of resistance members, Jews, communists, Jehovah’s Witnesses and illicit traders, all arrested for acts the German occupiers considered an offense. During the war years, the prison had already earned the nickname the ‘Orange Hotel’ for all the resistance members imprisoned there.\n\nWell-known and lesser-known prisoners\nThe prisoners included people well-known in the Netherlands such as ‘Soldier of Orange’ Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema, Rudolph Cleveringa, Titus Brandsma, George Maduro, Pim Boellaard, Corrie ten Boom, Trix Terwindt, Anton de Kom, Simon Vestdijk, Henri Pieck and Heinz Polzer (also known as Drs. P.). Countless others shared their fate. For many of them, the Oranjehotel was the first in a long line of German prisons and concentration camps. It was the final destination for over 250 prisoners, who were executed by firing squad on nearby Waalsdorpervlakte.\n\nImpactful stories\nUntil 2009, the cell block was still in use as a prison and was not open to the public. After a lengthy restoration and renovation, the Oranjehotel was opened by King Willem-Alexander in September 2019 as a memorial center. The Nationaal Monument Oranjehotel (Oranjehotel national monument), tells stories of fear, hope, faith and patriotism, and through exhibitions and films illustrates the conditions in which the prisoners lived. The museum shows the fragility of freedom and the choices people make in the face of injustice, suppression and persecution.",

From September 18, 2021 through January 16, 2022, Alkmaar houses the best of van Allart van Everdingen’s rich and varied body of works, courtesy of special loans from museums such as the Mauritshuis, the Rijksmuseum, the Alte Pinakotek in Munich, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts as well as national and international private collections.\n\nIn van Allart van Everdingen’s footsteps\nIn autumn 2019, photographer Pascal Vossen and curator Christi Klinkert (Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar) traveled the southern coasts of Sweden and Norway. Vossen took photographs of motifs and locations painted by van Everdingen, to prepare for the exhibition.

See what a court of justice was like in the past.\n\nStedelijk Museum Kampen focuses on four main themes: Water, Faith, Justice, and the House of Orange.\n\nWater\nKampen owes its wealth to the water. The water made it possible to trade with distant places, which became very lucrative. But the water was dangerous, too. The rooms focusing on the topic of Water illustrate the history of Kampen and the water. The old Hanseatic League, the rise and fall of the Hanseatic city, the current rise in sea levels: Kampen has always been closely linked to the water.\n\nFaith\nTraditionally, religion has played an important role in Kampen. Until the Reformation, Kampen was a Roman Catholic city. The city center was home to large churches and monasteries. After the Reformation, Kampen turned Protestant, and two theological universities were established here. Much has been preserved from this period. All this is on display in the rooms focusing on faith.\n\nJustice\nKampen received city rights in the early Middle Ages. It therefore gained its own council and the right to administer justice which took place in the Schepenzaal (Aldermen’s Hall) dating from 1545 which is the museum’s showpiece. The hall has not changed for centuries. Visit the Schepenzaal and themed room to find out what administration and justice were like in the past.\n\nThe House of Orange\nStedelijk Museum Kampen displays portrait paintings of all stadtholders and kings of the House of Orange. All the portraits show the subjects from head to toe.\n\nStedelijk Museum Kampen has two ancillary locations: the Gemeentelijke Expositieruimte, municipal exhibition space, located in a former synagogue, and the Koornmarktspoort, a medieval city gate. All three locations house temporary exhibitions.",

People enjoy being weighed on the original scales dating from 1482, and receiving a personalized certificate. This particular site was used for weighing as early as the 17th century.

Perhaps that’s why not a single person was ever condemned as a witch here at Oudewater.\n\nWitch hunt\nThe museum, in the former weighing house, introduces its visitors to the history of the prosecution of witchcraft and the role the Oudewater weighing house played in it through captivating audiovisual presentations, an exhibition and the original scales.

Step into the life of the De Jong family and judge for yourself whether it was those ‘good old days’.\n\nCome see, listen and smell\nThe working-class district used to be a neighborhood where “the common people” lived, often in small houses in poor condition. Every city had its neighbourhoods. Utrecht had Wijk C, once so called because the French occupiers could not (or would not) pronounce the Dutch names.\n\nWijk C\nWijk C was Utrecht's most densely populated neighborhood 100 years ago. In the district, large families lived in small hovels. The residents lived mostly outside. Everyone had to work hard for a few cents and there was a lot of poverty. But there was also much togetherness and solidarity. Although Wijk C is the only district in Utrecht still marked with a letter, it has changed a lot. People still live close together and there are all kinds of challenges in living together. In the museum, residents of Utrecht explain how they view issues that are still current in the working-class neighborhood. The working-class neighborhood of 100 years ago no longer exists, but it has resulted in the People's Neighborhood Museum.\n\nDe Jong Family\nStep into the life of the de Jong family and discover the big and small stories of ordinary life in a working-class neighborhood in Utrecht.
